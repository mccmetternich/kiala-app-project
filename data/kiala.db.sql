The culprit? A hormone that most women have never heard of, yet it plays a crucial role in metabolism, fat storage, and overall health.\n\n## What Is This Mysterious Hormone?\n\nThe hormone in question is leptin - often called the "satiety hormone." Leptin is produced by your fat cells and signals to your brain when you''ve had enough to eat. However, as women age, especially after 40, leptin resistance can develop.\n\n## Signs of Leptin Resistance\n\n- Difficulty feeling full after meals\n- Intense cravings for high-calorie foods\n- Weight gain around the midsection\n- Fatigue and low energy\n- Difficulty losing weight despite diet and exercise\n\n## Take Action Today\n\nDon''t let leptin resistance continue to sabotage your health goals. Start implementing these strategies today, and within 2-4 weeks, you should notice improved appetite control and easier weight management.','\n',char(10)),'hidden-hormone-sabotaging-weight-loss','Weight Loss','https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515377905703-c4788e51af15?w=800&h=600&fit=crop',1,1,1,8,12849,'2025-11-24 21:09:12','2025-11-25 02:11:59','2025-11-25 02:11:59',0,NULL,'{}');

They are addressing the symptoms while ignoring the root cause.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong>The question is not \"how do I eat less?\" It is \"how do I support my gut so my hormones can function properly?\"</strong></p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\">This realization is what prompted my investigation.

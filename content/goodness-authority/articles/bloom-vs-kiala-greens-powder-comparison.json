That's not really my style.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">But then I actually sat down with both supplement facts panels. And what I found wasn't a close call. It wasn't even in the same category. One of these products has serious formulation issues that most women would never catch \u2014 and the other has something I've rarely seen in this space: real clinical evidence behind its core ingredient.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\">So here we are.

Not the marketing. Not the Instagram feed. The label.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\"><strong>Bloom's serving size is 5.64 grams.</strong> That's about a teaspoon and a half. Into that tiny amount, they've crammed seven separate proprietary blends: fiber, green superfood, pre/probiotic, fruit and vegetable, antioxidant beauty, digestive enzyme, and adaptogenic. Seven categories in what amounts to a heaping teaspoon of powder.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">A registered dietitian reviewing Bloom in 2026 noted the product contains barely 1.5 grams of actual greens per serving \u2014 with no indication of the actual nutrient amounts per dose. Without that transparency, neither you nor I can assess whether these ingredients are present in amounts that would actually do anything.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\"><strong>Kiala's serving size is 8.3 grams</strong> \u2014 50% more product per scoop. And rather than fragmenting into seven micro-blends with undisclosed amounts, Kiala concentrates its formula around six organic anchor ingredients \u2014 spirulina, chlorella, kale, wheatgrass, acai, and coconut water powder \u2014 plus a clinically studied antioxidant complex called Spectra\u00ae.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Fewer categories. More substance where it matters.</p>"

It has ingredients that have been studied individually in other contexts, but there's no validated, proprietary complex at the center of its formula with human clinical trials.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">Kiala does.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">Spectra\u00ae is a blend of 30+ fruits, vegetables, and herbs with two published peer-reviewed studies \u2014 including a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in human participants. Not a test tube. Not a petri dish. Real women and men, real blood draws, real measurements.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">The study, published in the <em>Journal of Food Science and Nutrition</em> (Nemzer, Fink & Fink, 2014), found that Spectra\u00ae reduced cellular free radical production by up to 17%, achieved 3.5x inhibition of superoxide generation, nearly completely inhibited hydrogen peroxide formation, more than doubled the inhibition of cellular inflammatory response, and increased bioavailable nitric oxide \u2014 which supports circulation, cardiovascular function, and the delivery of nutrients throughout the body.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\">In over a decade of analyzing supplements for clients, I rarely encounter ingredients with this level of published human evidence.

However, they don't disclose CFU counts \u2014 the standard measure of probiotic potency. Most clinical probiotic research uses doses of 1 billion CFU or higher, so without this information, it's difficult to assess therapeutic potential.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">Their formula also includes chicory root fructo-oligosaccharides in the fiber blend. While prebiotics can be beneficial, chicory root is a known high-FODMAP compound that can cause gas and bloating in sensitive individuals \u2014 which seems counterproductive for a product marketed for bloating relief.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">Kiala takes a different path: antioxidant-based digestive support. The organic chlorella and spirulina provide gentle detoxification support. The coconut water powder delivers natural electrolytes. And the Spectra\u00ae blend's antioxidant activity helps reduce oxidative stress that contributes to digestive inflammation. It's less about flooding the gut with probiotics and more about creating optimal conditions for gut function.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Both approaches have merit, but for women dealing with unpredictable digestive reactions, the antioxidant approach tends to be gentler and more consistent.</p>"

I wrote it because women deserve honest information from someone who reads the labels, understands the science, and doesn't have an influencer deal clouding their judgment.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">Bloom introduced millions of women to daily greens. That's worth acknowledging. But introducing someone to a category and being the best product in that category are two very different things.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you've been on Bloom and feel like something's missing \u2014 the bloating hasn't fully resolved, the energy boost never materialized, or you're just tired of the aftertaste \u2014 it might be time to try the greens powder that over a million women have already switched to. Your body will tell you the difference. Give it 7 days.</p>"

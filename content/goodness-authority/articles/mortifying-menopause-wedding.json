Then the DJ handed her the microphone. 200 faces turned toward her. Her daughter looked up with tears already forming. And Linda's mind went completely, catastrophically blank. Not nervous-blank. Gone. Like someone had erased the file. She stood there for eight seconds that felt like eight years. 'I could feel the heat crawling up my neck. Everyone is watching me fall apart.' She mumbled something, made a joke about 'mother of the bride brain,' and sat down. Then locked herself in the bathroom and cried.",

I almost cried. Fourteen months later, I gave a toast at my nephew's wedding. Nailed it. This time I cried the right kind of tears.",

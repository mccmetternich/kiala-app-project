This formula is different: transparent dosing, Spectra\u00ae with published human trials, and nothing that undermines what you're trying to build."

I let fear run my life.\n\nWhen I found this wellness community and learned about the gut-hormone connection, something clicked. I wasn't losing my mind. My system was failing me\u2014and systems can be fixed.\n\nI started the greens in March. By May, I was sleeping through the night for the first time in years. By July, I noticed I was finishing my own sentences again. In August, I said yes to a work presentation.\n\nI was terrified. But I did it. And I didn't freeze.\n\nLast month, I gave a toast at my nephew's wedding. I cried\u2014the good kind. My daughter was there. She hugged me afterward and said, 'There you are, Mom.'\n\nI got myself back. That's what this gave me.",

          {
            "question": "\"How is this different from the supplements I've already tried?\"",
            "answer": "Most supplements address individual symptoms—a B vitamin for energy, magnesium for sleep, etc. This addresses the underlying system: your gut-hormone axis. When that functions properly, many symptoms resolve on their own. It's the difference between putting out individual fires and fixing the faulty wiring."
          },
          {
            "question": "\"I've tried greens powders before and didn't notice anything.\"",
            "answer": "Most greens powders contain sugar alcohols that actually irritate the gut, proprietary blends with undisclosed (often weak) doses, and no clinical backing. This formula is different: transparent dosing, Spectra® with published human trials, and nothing that undermines what you're trying to build."
          },
          {
            "question": "\"How long before I notice something?\"",
            "answer": "Most women in our community report subtle shifts in sleep and energy by week 2-3. Clearer thinking often follows by week 4-6. But this isn't a quick fix—it's building a foundation. Give it 60 days before judging. That's why there's a 45-day guarantee."
          },
          {
            "question": "\"What if I have a 'mortifying moment' anyway?\"",
            "answer": "You might. Life doesn't stop being stressful. But here's what Linda told me: 'Even when I get nervous now, I recover faster. The floor doesn't fall out.' That's what a solid foundation gives you—not perfection, but resilience."

I let fear run my life.\n\nWhen I found Dr. Amy's community and learned about the gut-hormone connection, something clicked. I wasn't losing my mind. My system was failing me—and systems can be fixed.\n\nI started the greens in March. By May, I was sleeping through the night for the first time in years. By July, I noticed I was finishing my own sentences again. In August, I said yes to a work presentation.\n\nI was terrified. But I did it. And I didn't freeze.\n\nLast month, I gave a toast at my nephew's wedding. I cried—the good kind. My daughter was there. She hugged me afterward and said, 'There you are, Mom.'\n\nI got myself back. That's what this gave me.",

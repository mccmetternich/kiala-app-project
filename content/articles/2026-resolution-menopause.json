            "answer": "Most greens powders are proprietary blends with weak doses and sugar alcohols that actually irritate the gut. This formula is different: transparent dosing, Spectra® with published clinical trials, and nothing that undermines the gut you're trying to support. 83% of our community members are still taking it after 60 days—that's not typical for any supplement."

            "question": "\"Isn't this just another quick fix?\"",
            "answer": "Actually, it's the opposite. Quick fixes promise dramatic results fast. This is about building a foundation so that everything else you try actually has a chance to work. It's the slow, unsexy approach—but it's the one that sticks."
          },

            "answer": "You absolutely could—if you had the energy to cook perfectly and exercise consistently. But that's the catch-22: you need the foundation to have the energy to build the foundation. Sometimes you need a bridge to get there."

Just do one thing: support your gut first. Everything else later.\n\nIt's been three months. I haven't 'transformed.' But I have energy. I'm not bloated. I sleep through most nights. And for the first time in six years, I don't feel like I've failed.\n\nThat's what this gave me. Not a miracle. Just a foundation that finally holds.",

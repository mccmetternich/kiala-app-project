Menopause has fundamentally altered how you metabolize food, regulate energy, manage stress, and even how your brain processes motivation.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">And at the center of all of it? Your gut.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">The gut-hormone axis controls almost everything women blame themselves for failing at: energy levels, cravings, mood stability, weight, sleep. When menopause disrupts your gut microbiome—specifically the estrobolome—your willpower is fighting a battle it cannot win.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong>You're not lazy. You're not weak. You're building resolutions on a broken foundation.</strong></p>"

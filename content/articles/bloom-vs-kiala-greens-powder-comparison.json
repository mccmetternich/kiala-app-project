That's not really my style.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">But then I actually sat down with both supplement facts panels. And what I found wasn't a close call. It wasn't even in the same category. One of these products has serious formulation issues that most women would never catch — and the other has something I've rarely seen in this space: real clinical evidence behind its core ingredient.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\">So here we are. Let me walk you through exactly what I found.</p>"

Not the marketing. Not the Instagram feed. The label.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\"><strong>Bloom's serving size is 5.5 grams.</strong> That's about a teaspoon and a half. Into that tiny amount, they've crammed seven separate proprietary blends: fiber, green superfood, pre/probiotic, fruit and vegetable, antioxidant beauty, digestive enzyme, and adaptogenic. Seven categories in what amounts to a heaping teaspoon of powder.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">A registered dietitian reviewing Bloom in 2026 noted the product contains barely 1.5 grams of actual greens per serving — with no indication of the actual nutrient amounts per dose. Without that transparency, neither you nor I can assess whether these ingredients are present in amounts that would actually do anything.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\"><strong>Kiala's serving size is 8.3 grams</strong> — 50% more product per scoop. And rather than fragmenting into seven micro-blends with undisclosed amounts, Kiala concentrates its formula around six organic anchor ingredients — spirulina, chlorella, kale, wheatgrass, acai, and coconut water powder — plus a clinically studied antioxidant complex called Spectra®.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Fewer categories. More substance where it matters.</p>"

It has ingredients that have been studied individually in other contexts, but there's no validated, proprietary complex at the center of its formula with human clinical trials.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">Kiala does.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">Spectra® is a blend of 30+ fruits, vegetables, and herbs with two published peer-reviewed studies — including a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in human participants. Not a test tube. Not a petri dish. Real women and men, real blood draws, real measurements.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">The study, published in the <em>Journal of Food Science and Nutrition</em> (Nemzer, Fink & Fink, 2014), found that Spectra® reduced cellular free radical production by up to 17%, achieved 3.5x inhibition of superoxide generation, nearly completely inhibited hydrogen peroxide formation, more than doubled the inhibition of cellular inflammatory response, and increased bioavailable nitric oxide — which supports circulation, cardiovascular function, and the delivery of nutrients throughout the body.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\">I've been in clinical practice for over three decades. I can count on one hand the number of supplement ingredients I've encountered with this level of published human evidence. This is not marketing language. This is peer-reviewed science.</p>"

Bloom's entire brand identity is built around gut health and bloating relief. It's the first thing on their packaging. It's every influencer talking point. So when I discovered that Bloom doesn't disclose its probiotic CFU count — the standard measure of probiotic potency — I was genuinely surprised.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">Most clinical probiotic research uses doses of 1 billion CFU or higher. Without knowing Bloom's count, there's no way to assess whether the probiotics are present at clinically meaningful levels or are simply label decoration.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">What concerned me more: Bloom's first listed ingredient is chicory root fructo-oligosaccharides — a known high-FODMAP compound. FODMAPs are fermentable carbohydrates that can cause gas, cramping, and bloating in sensitive individuals. For the women in my practice — many of whom are dealing with hormonal shifts that already make their gut more reactive — a product that leads with a high-FODMAP ingredient while marketing itself as a bloating solution is, frankly, counterproductive.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">Kiala takes a different path to digestive support. The organic chlorella and spirulina provide detoxification support. The coconut water powder delivers natural electrolytes that help with the water retention that so many of my patients deal with cyclically. And the antioxidant activity of Spectra® helps reduce the oxidative stress that contributes to digestive inflammation. It's a different mechanism — less about flooding the gut with undisclosed probiotics and more about creating the conditions where your gut can function properly.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\">In the community, 84% of women who tried Kiala reported feeling lighter and less bloated within the first 7 days. That's consistent with what I've observed.</p>"

I wrote it because women deserve honest information from someone who reads the labels, understands the science, and doesn't have an influencer deal clouding their judgment.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">Bloom introduced millions of women to daily greens. That's worth acknowledging. But introducing someone to a category and being the best product in that category are two very different things.</p><p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you've been on Bloom and feel like something's missing — the bloating hasn't fully resolved, the energy boost never materialized, or you're just tired of the aftertaste — it might be time to try the greens powder that over a million women have already switched to. Your body will tell you the difference. Give it 7 days.</p>"

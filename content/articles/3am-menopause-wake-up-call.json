Too tired for my grandkids.\n\nThree weeks on Kiala, I woke at 6AM and realized I hadn't been up once. I laid there and cried.\n\nThat was two months ago. I sleep most nights now. I'm back in our bedroom. I feel like myself again.\n\nIf you're where I was—exhausted, hopeless, thinking this is just how menopause is—please try this.",
